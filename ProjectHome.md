This framework was developed for my final year degree project. It incorporates a lot of features and was developed over 8 months.

The source code can be browsed and checked out under Source->Browse or Source->Checkout respectively.

A game created using the framework is available under Downloads->crabbytennis-exec.zip this ROM can be used with the DeSmuME emulator only due to this emulator being the only one to emulate the DS filesystem.

A version of DeSmuME emulator enabled for use with the ROM is available under Downloads->DeSmuME.exe
